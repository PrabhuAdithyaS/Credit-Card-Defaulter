Objective:Â¶
Objective of our project is to predict which customer might default in upcoming months. Before going any fudther let's have a quick look on defination of what actually meant by Credit Card Default.

We are all aware what is credit card. It is type of payment payment card in which charges are made against a line of credit instead of the account holder's cash deposits. When someone uses a credit card to make a purchase, that person's account accrues a balance that must be paid off each month.

Credit card default happens when you have become severely delinquent on your credit card payments.Missing credit card payments once or twice does not count as a default. A payment default occurs when you fail to pay the Minimum Amount Due on the credit card for a few consecutive months.
